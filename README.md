# zenafactions-depricated

## [Zenafactions has been moved!]
I'm currently in the process of rewriting the whole plugin, there's a different repo for that. The code presented here is old and no longer supported.

This is an achival repo of the source code of pre 1.0 versions of the bukkit/paper plugin ZenaFactions by smups.

## [THIS REPOSITORY IS NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED]
Feel free to fork or otherwise use my code in your own projects, but beware that I will not respond to any comments.
